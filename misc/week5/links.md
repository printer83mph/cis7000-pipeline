# Week 5: database! (links)

Here is a video showing uploading and retreiving two assets, using my (currently) web-based GUI MVP! It also shows the assets appearing in the database itself.

They're image files for now so I can preview them in the browser but it works with any file format.

All of the code can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/printer83mph/asset-database), at the most recent commit hash **3c0d045**.

I've also included a PDF in this upload, with my design doc and screenshots from the MVP UI.
